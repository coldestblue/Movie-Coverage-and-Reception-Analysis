# Typology

## 1. Production
**Description:**  
Articles discussing aspects of the movie-making process, including soundtracks, costumes, set design, scriptwriting, franchise/sequel development, screening processes, and actor training. Interviews or featurettes that focus solely on the production process belong here.

**Good Example:**  
*"‘Gladiator II’ Composer Harry Gregson-Williams Sought Mentor Hans Zimmer’s Approval To Tackle Sequel"*  
This focuses on the creative process behind the film's soundtrack, directly tying into production elements.

**Negative Example:**  
*"Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson Admits Whizzing in Bottles on Set of 'Red One'"*  
While it mentions set-related behavior, this anecdote is irrelevant to the movie's production aspects and belongs to **Cast Spotlight**.

**Edge Case:**  
*"‘Wicked’ Director Jon M. Chu On Finding His Elphaba And Glinda"*  
Although it discusses actors, the main focus is on the casting process, which is a crucial production decision.

## 3. Marketing and Promotion
**Description:**  
Articles covering promotional activities, such as red carpet events, merchandise, BTS and trailers, “what to watch” lists, and general “everything we know about movie X” features. However, it excludes cast interviews.

This highlights a promotional partnership tied directly to merchandise.

**Negative Example:**  
*"Paul Mescal in Gucci at the GLADIATOR II Australian Premiere"*

Despite mentioning a featurette, the focus is on specific traits of the movie-making process, categorizing it under **Production**.

Articles discussing financial performance, box office projections or competition among films.

**Good Example:**

## 5. Cast Spotlight
**Description:**  
Articles centered on actors, their interviews/statements, personal lives, or promotional material solely focusing on the cast. If an article emphasizes a production aspect through an actor's statement, it belongs in **Production** instead.

The article highlights the actor’s personal and professional connection to the role.

**Negative Example:**  
*"Paul Mescal's 'Gladiator II' character appears in the first movie — here's a refresher on who Lucius is"*  
Despite mentioning the actor, the article focuses on the plot, fitting better in **Plot**.

**Edge Case:**

This falls under **Cast Spotlight** as it revolves around a personal statement and doesn’t reveal any relevant details about the production process.

## 7. Unrelated to Movies
**Description:**  
Articles irrelevant to the selected films or movies in general.
